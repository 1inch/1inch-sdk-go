This SDK will be open for contributions from the community. Contribution guidelines will be added soon!

### Versioning

This library is currently in the developer preview phase (versions 0.x.x). There will be significant changes to the
design of this library leading up to a 1.0.0 release. You can expect the API calls, library structure, etc. to break
between each release. Once the library version reaches 1.0.0 and beyond, it will follow traditional semver conventions.

### Project structure

This SDK is powered by a [client struct](https://github.com/1inch/1inch-sdk/blob/main/golang/client/client.go) that
contains instances of all Services used to talk to the 1inch APIs

Each Service maps 1-to-1 with the underlying Dev Portal REST API.
See [SwapService](https://github.com/1inch/1inch-sdk/blob/main/golang/client/swap.go) as an example. Under each
function, you will find the matching REST API path)

Each Service uses various types and functions to do its job that are kept separate from the main service file. These can
be found in the accompanying folder within the client directory (see
the [swap](https://github.com/1inch/1inch-sdk/tree/main/golang/client/swap) package)

### Type generation

Type generation is done using the `generate_types.sh` script. To add a new openapi file or update an existing one, place
the openapi file in `openapi` and run the script from the root of the project. It will generate the types files for all openapi specs and place them in the
appropriately-named sub-folder inside the `generatedtypes` directory.

### OpenAPI file formatting

For consistency, openapi files should be formatted with `prettier`

This can be installed globally using npm:

`npm install -g prettier`

If using GoLand, you can set up this action to run automatically using File Watchers:

1. Go to Settings or Preferences > Tools > File Watchers.
2. Click the + button to add a new watcher.
3. For `File type`, choose JSON.
4. For `Scope`, choose Project Files.
5. For `Program`, provide the path to the `prettier`. This can be gotten by running `which prettier`.
6. For `Arguments`, use `--write $FilePath$`.
7. For `Output paths to refresh`, use `$FilePath$`.
8. Ensure the Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher option is checked
